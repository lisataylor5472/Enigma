# ENIGMA

Welcome to my Enigma Machine!

It is a program that uses a command line interface to run an encryption and decryption tool.

<hr />

## HOW TO ‍- COMING SOON

Use the two runner files, `encrypt.rb` and `decrypt.rb` to execute
encryption and decryption of a message contained in `message.txt`.

## SELF-ASSESSMENT ✔️


  ### Functionality
  - [ ] Enigma Class with `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods successfully implemented
  - [ ] `encrypt` and `decrypt` CLI successfully implemented

  #### Notes:

  ### Object Oriented Programming
  - [ ] Project is broken into logical components - appropriately encapsulated
  - [ ] No classes are unreasonably small or large,
  - [ ] Classes do not contain knowledge/info/behavior that they shouldn't know about.
  - [ ] Single responsibilities can be articulated
      - Enigma Class
      - Cipher Class
      - Cipherable Module
      - Keyable Module
      - Datable Module

  #### Notes:

  ### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
  - [ ] Code is properly indented, spaced, and concise
  - [ ] All class, method, variable, and file names follow convention
  - [ ] Most of the enumerables and data structures chosen are the most efficient
  - [ ] Implemented multiple hashes in a logical manner

  #### Notes:

  ### Test Driven Development
  - [ ] Every class has a spec file and every method within a class is completely
  tested to verify the expected behavior.
  - [ ] Module methods are tested within the Class spec file that they apply to
  - [ ] Edge cases are tested:
    - [ ] leading zeroes - where applicable
    - [ ] special characters outside of the character set
    - [ ] uppercased messages
    - [ ] shift amounts greater than character set length


  - [ ] Tests were written first before implementation of code
  - [ ] `Simplecov` shows coverage at XXX%

  #### Notes:

  ### Version Control
  - [ ] Total commits: XX
  - [ ] Uses logical pull request workflow.
